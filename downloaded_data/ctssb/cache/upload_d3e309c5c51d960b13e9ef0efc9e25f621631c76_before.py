    Support uploads by email
    ------------------------
    Some user devices don't support web uploads such as mobile phones.
    Prompt these users to simply email photos to an email address for upload.
    Phones have a built in "email photo" utility, so no app download is needed.
    Attachments are processed extracting JPEG images.
    Extracted JPEG is added to the last updated collection of a user
        with the same email as the sender.
    Confirmation of successful upload sent just in case the email was spoofed.
    As this is not an iOS app, uploads will also work for devices such as
        Nokia S40 and S60 devices.
