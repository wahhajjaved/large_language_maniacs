"""Network allocator

This module supplies an interface for an allocator of network identifiers to
be used by API calls such as ``network_create``.

For HaaS to operate correctly, a network allocator must be registered by
calling ``set_network_allocator`` exactly once -- typically this is done by an
extension.
