        Since threadpool's apply_async runs the callback only when the call to
        this method ends without any exceptions, it is *very important* to handle
        exceptions correctly here. Failure to do so will end up in _task_done not
        called, which will make has_pending_work always return True.

        Python 3 has an error_callback in the apply_async method, which we could
        use in the future.
