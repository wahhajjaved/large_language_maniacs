@change: 2015/10/15 eball Added method names to debug output
@change: 2015/10/15 eball disableservice now checks audit and isrunning
@change: 2016/06/10 dkennel wrapped audit in try catch in case service is not
installed.
@change: 2016/11/03 rsn upgrading the interface to allow for more flexibility.
@change: 2017/01/31 Breen Malmberg clarified the difference between auditservice
        and isrunning methods in the documentation; clarified the nature of the
        two parameters in each of those methods in the doc strings as well
@author: 2017-23-2017 rsn modified/simplified to second generation

    The ServiceHelper class serves as an abstraction layer between rules that
    need to manipulate services and the actual implementation of changing
    service status on various operating systems.

    @Note: Interface methods abstracted to allow for different parameter
           lists for different helpers.  This moves the requirement for 
           input validation the the concrete helpers.
