    will then be saved to the file when :func:`save` is called.

    This will also interact with :class:`networktables.NetworkTable` by creating a table
    called "Preferences" with all the key-value pairs. To save using
    `NetworkTable`, simply set the boolean at position ~S A V E~ to true.
    Also, if the value of any variable is " in the `NetworkTable`, then
    that represents non-existence in the `Preferences` table.
