Overview
--------
`Condition`<Condition>s represent any conditions that can be satisfied. Each Condition is associated with an owner (a
`Component`<Component> that the Condition "belongs" to, relevant for relative conditions such as `EveryNCalls`), and
a `Scheduler`<Scheduler>, which maintains most of the data required to test satisfaction. These properties can usually
be determined automatically based on the context in which Conditions are created.

Creating new Conditions
-----------------------
Each Condition must
    - be a subclass of `Condition`<Condition>
    - pass `dependencies` as the first argument to the __init__ function of Condition
    - pass `func` as the second argument to the __init__ function of Condition

In determining whether a Condition is satisfied, `func` is called with `dependencies` as parameter (and optionally,
additional named and unnamed arguments).

Hint:
    If you do not want to use the dependencies parameter, and instead want to use only args or kwargs, you may
    pass a dummy variable for dependencies. See `AfterNCallsCombined`<AfterNCallsCombined> for reference:

    class AfterNCallsCombined(Condition):
        def __init__(self, *dependencies, n=None, time_scale=TimeScale.TRIAL):

                if n is None:
                    raise ConditionError('{0}: keyword argument n is None'.format(type(self).__name__))
