    # "not interface foo" filter here.

    # The first goal is to configure "Destination NAT" (DNAT).  We're just
    # going to rewrite the destination address of traffic arriving on the
    # specified port so it looks like it is destined for the specified ip
    # instead of destined for "us".  This gets the packets delivered to the

    # its way out of this system it is also necessary to further modify and
    # then track that packet.  We want it to look like it comes from us (the
    # downstream client will be *very* confused if the node we're passing the
    # packet on to replies *directly* to them; and by confused I mean it will
    # be totally broken, of course) so we also need to "masquerade" in the
    # postrouting chain.  This changes the source address of the packet to the
    # address of the external interface the packet is exiting upon.  Doing SNAT
    # here would be a little bit more efficient because the kernel could avoid
    # looking up the external interface's address for every single packet.  But
