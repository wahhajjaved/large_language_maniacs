Offset Mirror Classes

This script contains all the classes relating to the offset mirrors used in the
FEE and XRT. Each offset mirror contains a stepper motor and piezo motor to
control the pitch, two pairs of motors to control the gantry and then a
coupling motor control the coupling between the gantry motor pairs.

Classes implemented here are as follows:

OMMotor
    Motor class that will represent all the individual motors on the offset
    mirror system. The pitch stepper and all the gantry motors are interfaced
    with using this class.

Pitch
    Class to handle the control of the pitch mechanism

OffsetMirror
    High level device that includes all the relevant components of the offset
    mirror. This includes a pitch, piezo, primary gantry x, and primary gantry
    y motors. This is the class that should be used to control the offset
    mirrors.

    When controlling the pitch motor, if the piezo is set to 'PID' mode, then
    the pitch mechanism is setup to first move the stepper as close to the
    desired position, then the piezo will kick in to constantly try and correct
    any positional changes. When in this mode the piezo cannot be controlled
