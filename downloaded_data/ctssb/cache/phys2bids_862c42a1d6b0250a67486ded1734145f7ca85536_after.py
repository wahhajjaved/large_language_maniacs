class BlueprintInput():
    """
    Main input object for phys2bids.
    Contains the blueprint to be populated.
    !!! Pay attention: there's rules on how to populate this object.
    See below ("Attention") !!!

    Input (Properties)
    ------------------
    timeseries : (ch, [tps]) list
        List of numpy 1d arrays - one for channel, plus one for time.
        Time channel has to be the first, trigger the second.
        Contains all the timeseries recorded.
        Supports different frequencies!
    freq : (ch) list of floats
        List of floats - one per channel.
        Contains all the frequencies of the recorded channel.
        Support different frequencies!
    ch_name : (ch) list of strings
        List of names of the channels - can be the header of the columns
        in the output files.
    units : (ch) list of strings
        List of the units of the channels.

    Properties
    ----------
    ch_amount: int
        Number of channels (ch).

    Optional properties
    -------------------
    num_timepoints_found: int
        Amount of timepoints found in the automatic count,
        *if* check_trigger_amount() is run

    Methods
    -------
    rename_channels:
        Changes the list "ch_name" in a controlled way.
    return_index:
        Returns the proper list entry of all the
        properties of the object, given an index.
    delete_at_index:
        Returns all the proper list entry of the
        properties of the object, given an index.
    check_trigger_amount:
        Counts the amounts of triggers and corrects time offset
        in "time" ndarray. Also adds property ch_amount.

    Attention
    ---------
    The timeseries (and as a consequence, all the other properties)
    should start with an entry for time and an entry for trigger.
    Both should have the same length - hence same sampling. Meaning:
    - timeseries[0] → ndarray representing time
    - timeseries[1] → ndarray representing trigger
    - timeseries[0].shape == timeseries[1].shape

    As a consequence:
    - freq[0] == freq[1]
    - ch_name[0] = 'time'
    - ch_name[1] = 'trigger'
    - units[0] = 's'
    - Actual number of channels (ANC) +1 <= ch_amount <= ANC +2
