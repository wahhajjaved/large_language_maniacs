    Step 1: use lists

    Step 2: add some object related dict which prevents calling twice the same method

    Step 3: add some time information for deferred execution

    Step 4: use MySQL as a way to store events (with locks)

    Step 5: use periodic Timer to wakeup Scheduler

    Step 6: add multiple threads on a single Scheduler

    Step 7: add control thread to kill "events which last too long"

    Some data:

    - reindexObject = 50 ms

    - calling a MySQL read = 0.7 ms

    - calling a simple method by HTTP = 30 ms

    - calling a complex method by HTTP = 500 ms
