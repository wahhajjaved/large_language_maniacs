  Parent is always the corresponding Account.

  There's 3 types of entity types:
  1. Single day summary. AccountStatsDay. Key name is 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
  2. Single month summary. AccountStatsMulti. Key name is 'YYYY-MM'.
  3. 'XX last days' rolling summary. AccountStatsMulti. Key name is the string
     'XX'.

  The statistics encompass all the reviews WHERE THE INITIAL EMAIL WAS SENT IN
  THE DAY. This is important, it's not 'when the issue was created' neither when
  the reviewer woke up. This means finally reviewing a week old CL will worsen
  your score of last week. This could create a bad incentive, but if you punted
  on a review for a week, the author already hates you anyway.

  WARNING: entities can be updated several days after the day they represent, as
  stated in the previous paragraph.

  CLs where no message was ever sent are not considered, since the date is
  pinned on the first message.

  Users that never created an Issue are not considered. See
  views.figure_out_real_accounts().

  In each case, the entity won't exist if the user had no activity, so the
  number of entities scales linearly with the activty going on. More
  specifically for the rolling summary, the entity will only exist if the user
  had activity in the past XX days, as it will be deleted otherwise on the next
  cron job run.

  This entity is written by a cron job once per day per account that had
  activity, so it doesn't need to be updated in a transaction, reducing the
  strain on the datastore. By precomputing the rolling summary, it makes
  displaying the leaderboard seamless performance-wise.
