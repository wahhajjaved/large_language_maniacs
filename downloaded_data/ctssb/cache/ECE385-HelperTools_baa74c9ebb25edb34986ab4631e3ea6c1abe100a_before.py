On to the good stuff.
    
Written by Jeremy DeJournett for our ECE385 final project in Fall 2016.
This script assumes the directory structure given by https://github.com/Atrifex/ECE385-HelperTools
This script will change the text files generated by png_to_3_txt.py to valid SystemVerilog code for a sprite table.

Usage (continued)
In lab 8, things like DistX and ObjectOn are calculated in the color mapper, which is okay when you only have one object,
but is a huge mess when you have many many objects. A better strategy is to give DrawX and DrawY to every object,
and let them determine whether or not they are meant to be on at that time. Additionally, you can calculate the SpriteX
and SpriteY indexes inside the object's module itself, and just wire those as inputs to the color mapper. This way,
the color mapper does not need to know where every object is, and instead cand just map the colors according to what it's told to do.

If you have any more questions, be sure to ask one of the 385 TAs.

I also apologize in advance for how messy this is. Feel free to submit a PR if you want to try cleaning it up a bit.
