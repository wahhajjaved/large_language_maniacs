    Load & preprocess functional data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    strPathNiiMask: str
        Path or mask used to restrict pRF model finding. Only voxels with
        a value greater than zero in the mask are considered.
    lstPathNiiFunc : list
        List of paths of functional data (nii files).
    lgcLinTrnd : bool
        Whether to perform linear trend removal on functional data.
    varSdSmthTmp : float
        Extent of temporal smoothing that is applied to functional data and
        pRF time course models, [SD of Gaussian kernel, in seconds]. If `zero`,
        no temporal smoothing is applied.
     varSdSmthSpt : float
        Extent of spatial smoothing [SD of Gaussian kernel, in mm]. If `zero`,
        no spatial smoothing is applied.
    varPar : int
        Number of processes to run in parallel (multiprocessing).

    Returns
    -------
    aryLgcMsk : np.array
        3D numpy array with logial values. Externally supplied mask (e.g grey
        matter mask). Voxels that are `False` in the mask are excluded.
    hdrMsk : nibabel-header-object
        Nii header of mask.
    aryAff : np.array
        Array containing 'affine', i.e. information about spatial positioning
        of mask nii data.
    aryLgcVar : np.array
        1D numpy array containing logical values. One value per voxel after
        mask has been applied. If `True`, the variance of the voxel's time
        course is larger than zero, and the voxel is included in the output
        array (`aryFunc`). If `False`, the varuance of the voxel's time course
        is zero, and the voxel has been excluded from the output (`aryFunc`).
        This is to avoid problems in the subsequent model fitting. This array
        is necessary to put results into original dimensions after model
        fitting.
    aryFunc : np.array
        2D numpy array containing preprocessed functional data, of the form
        aryFunc[voxelCount, time].
    tplNiiShp : tuple
        Spatial dimensions of input nii data (number of voxels in x, y, z
        direction). The data are reshaped during preprocessing, this
        information is needed to fit final output into original spatial
        dimensions.

    Notes
    -----
    Functional data is loaded from disk. Temporal and spatial smoothing can be
    applied. The functional data is reshaped, into the form aryFunc[voxel,
    time]. A mask is applied (externally supplied, e.g. a grey matter mask).
    Subsequently, the functional data is de-meaned, and intensities are
    converted into z-scores.
