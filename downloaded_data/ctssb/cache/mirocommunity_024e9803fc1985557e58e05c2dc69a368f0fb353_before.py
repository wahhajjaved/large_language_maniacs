    * PayPal sends us an "auth" parameter that we cannot validate.
    * This should be a POST so that cross-site scripting can't just upgrade people's sites.
    * This is not as secure as I would like.

    Suggested improvements:
    * The view that sends people to PayPal should store some state in the database
      that this view checks. It only permits an upgrade in that situation.
    * That could be the internal "payment_secret" to prevent CSRF.
    * A tricky site admin could still try POST the right data to this view, which would
      trigger the tier change.

    If you want to exploit a MC site and change its tier, and you can cause an admin
    with a cookie that's logged-in to visit pages you want, and you can get that admin
    to do a POST, you still have to POST a value for the "auth" key. Note that this is
