"""
Convergence loop for a node-specific dataset agent.

In practice most of the code is generic, but a few bits assume this agent
is node-specific.

The convergence agent runs a loop that attempts to converge the local
state with the desired configuration as transmitted by the control
service. This involves two state machines: ClusterStatus and ConvergenceLoop.
The ClusterStatus state machine receives inputs from the connection to the
control service, and sends inputs to the ConvergenceLoop state machine.

    Create a convergence loop FSM.

    Once cluster config+cluster state updates from control service are
    received the basic loop is:

    1. Discover local state.
    2. Calculate ``IStateChanges`` based on local state and cluster
       configuration and cluster state we received from control service.
    3. Execute the change.
    4. Sleep.

    However, if an update is received during sleep then we calculate based
    on that updated config+state whether a ``IStateChange`` needs to
    happen. If it does that means this change will have impact on what we
    do, so we interrupt the sleep. If calculation suggests a no-op then we
    keep sleeping. Notably we do **not** do a discovery of local state
    when an update is received while sleeping, since that is an expensive
    operation that can involve talking to external resources. Moreover an
    external update only implies external state/config changed, so we're
    not interested in the latest local state in trying to decide if this
    update requires us to do something; a recently cached version should
    suffice.
