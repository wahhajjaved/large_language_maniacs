"""This module provides routines for managing head nodes.

The exact API is currently in flux; We will attempt to make sure that
any given time the docstrings are accurate, but make no promises about
what it will say tomorrow.

Not everything is implemented to spec (or sometimes at all). Things
which are not are labeld as such (typically under the heading
"Conformance issues").

        `uri`, if provided, should be a libvirt uri, as documented at:

            http://libvirt.org/uri.html

        If a connection cannot be established, an `IOError` will be raised.

        Conformance issues:
        - An exception is never actually raised. currently we don't even
          establish a connection at this point, and so any failures
          will be silent.
        - `uri` is currently ignored.

        Questions:
        - do we even need a connection object? I start this when we were
          using the libvirt python api, but it's not clear we need this
          when we aren't establishing persistant connections. We may
          want to keep this here if we think we might transition to
          using the libvirt API, but frankly, I'm not sure there's a
          significant advantage in doing so.

          The only functionality this actually provides (or will) is the
          ability to specifiy non-default hypervisor uris. do we care?
