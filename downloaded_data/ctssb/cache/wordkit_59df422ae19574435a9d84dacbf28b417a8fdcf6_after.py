            - a tuple of a dictionary of features, for vowels and consonants.
            - an initialized FeatureExtractor instance.

        In the first two cases, the features you input to the Transformer are
        used. In the final case, the FeatureExtractor is used to extract
        features from your input during fitting.

        The choice between pre-defined featues and an is purely a matter of
        convenience. First extracting features using the FeatureExtractor
        leads to the same result as using the FeatureExtractor directly.
