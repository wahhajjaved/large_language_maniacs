## Event system:
##    - Canvas subclasses abstract basic windowing and input events
##    - High-level canvas will automatically forward events to scenegraph
##      and implement basic paint callback
##    - All events may trigger a list of callbacks which can be customized

##    - Must be possible to 
##        - respond to events by setting method attribute, overriding method,
##          or using event-connection decorator
##        - must be able to connect/disconnect functions
