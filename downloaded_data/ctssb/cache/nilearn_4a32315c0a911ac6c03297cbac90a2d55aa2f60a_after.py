        the score of the best parcellation of each iteration

    coef_ : the coefficients of the classifier fitted to the data

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_features)
        the parcellation chosen
        Two features have the same label if they are in the same parcel.
        The smaller label correspond to the smaller parcel

    Notes
    -----

    1) Firstly, ward tree is computed. Its a binary tree.
    The ward tree is represented by a list of pairsi
    Thus, the element i of this list represent the two children
    of the node i.
    /!\ The leaves are NOT represented in this list.

    2) Every cut of this tree gives a possible parcellation.
    Thus, we set the first parcellation as the root(s) of the tree, and,
    at each iteration, we construct a list of all the parcellations obtainable
    by cutting one of the parcels of the current parcellation in two.
    (we replace the parcel by its two children)

    3)We select the best parcellation of this list by cross validation
    This is the iteration parcellation.

    4)Finally, we obtain a list of al the parcellations choosen at
    each iteration.
    We choose the best by- selecting the best delta, ie the
    parcellation i+1, where
    score_of_parcellation[i+1] - score_of_parcellation[i] is max.

    5)We then compute a list wich associate to each voxel the label of its
    parcellation.
    Lastly, we fit the given estimator with this parcel-based signal.

    Comments
    --------

    After n iterations we have (n+1) parcellations
    (n choosen, plus the root(s)).

    The selected parcellation of the iteration i has n_components+n parcels.

    The root n is the element (n - n_leaves) of the ward tree
    (we assume that the features are referenced by integers from 0 to n_leaves,
    and the ward tree, an (int * int) list represent the roots of the tree by
    its two children)

    /!\ The leaves are NOT represented in this list.

    2) Every cut of this tree gives a possible parcellation.
    Thus, we set the first parcellation as the root(s) of the tree, and,
    at each iteration, we construct a list of all the parcellations obtainable
    by cutting one of the parcels of the current parcellation in two.
    (we replace the parcel by its two children)

    3)We select the best parcellation of this list by cross validation
    This is the iteration parcellation.

    4)Finally, we obtain a list of al the parcellations choosen at
    each iteration.
    We choose the best by- selecting the best delta, ie the
    parcellation i+1, where
    score_of_parcellation[i+1] - score_of_parcellation[i] is max.

    5)We then compute a list wich associate to each voxel the label of its
    parcellation.
    Lastly, we fit the given estimator with this parcel-based signal.

    Comments
    --------

    After n iterations we have (n+1) parcellations
    (n choosen, plus the root(s)).

    The selected parcellation of the iteration i has n_components+n parcels.

    The root n is the element (n - n_leaves) of the ward tree
    (we assume that the features are referenced by integers from 0 to n_leaves,
    and the ward tree, an (int * int) list represent the roots of the tree by
    its two children)
