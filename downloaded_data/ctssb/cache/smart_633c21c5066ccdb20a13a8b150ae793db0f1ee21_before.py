# Algorithm tweaks

pruneByWeight = 1
# If 1, we remember the best alternative found so far (in terms of changeset
# weight) and prune the search tree when better alternatives are not possible.
# This makes some monotonicity assumptions on the policy-determined changeset
# weights, which are not strictly true, so the policy enforcement might not be
# perfect; but the computation is much faster.
# If 0 (old behavior), no such pruning is done.

immediateUpdown = 1
# If 1, when we have to remove a package due to dependencies we immediately
# look for an up/downgrade replacement.
# If 0 (old behavior), we instead create a pending task and delay it for 
# later; this tends to cause huge remove cascades and, consequentially,
# slower running and larger changesets. However, it may provide more accurate
# intermediate changeset weights, thereby making pruning more accurate.

forkSearch = 1
# If 1, whenever there are multiple alternatives to explore this will be
# tries in parallel using the A* search algorithm; this allows us to
# find a feasible alternative quickly and, in conjunction with
# pruneByWeight=1, finish the computation quickly.
# If 0, we don't do that.

priorityScale = 5
# Value of a typical "moderate" package priority, for scaling. If very different
# from what the user uses, the importance of package priorities may be
# overestimated or underestimated by some policies.
