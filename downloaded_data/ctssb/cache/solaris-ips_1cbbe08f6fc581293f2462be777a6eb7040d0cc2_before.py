class Facets(dict):
        # store information on facets; subclass dict
        # and maintain ordered list of keys sorted
        # by length.

        # subclass __getitem__ so that queries w/
        # actual facets find match

        #
        # For image planning purposes and to be able to compare facet objects
        # deterministically, facets must be sorted.  They are first sorted by
        # source (more details below), then by length, then lexically.
        #
        # Facets can come from three different sources.
        #
        # SYSTEM facets are facets whose values are assigned by the system.
        # These are usually facets defined in packages which are not set in an
        # image, and the value assigned by the system is always true.  These
        # facets will usually never be found in a Facets dictionary.  (Facets
        # dictionaries only contain facets which are explicitly set.)
        #
        # LOCAL facets are facets which have been set locally in an image
        # using pkg(1) or the pkg api.  Explicitly set LOCAL facets are stored
        # in Facets.__local.  Facets which are not explicitly set but match an
        # explicitly set LOCAL facet glob pattern are also considered to be
        # LOCAL.
        #
        # PARENT facets are facets which are inherited from a parent image.
        # they are managed internally by the packaging subsystem.  Explicitly
        # inherited facets are stored in Facets.__inherited.  Facets which are
        # not explicitly set but match an explicitly set PARENT facet glob
        # pattern are also considered to be PARENT.
        #
        # When evaluating facets, all PARENT facets are evaluated before LOCAL
        # facets.  This is done by ensuring that all PARENT facets come before
        # any LOCAL facets in __keylist.  This is done because PARENT facets
        # exist to propagate faceted dependencies between linked images, which
        # is needed to ensure the solver can run successfully.  ie, if a
        # parent image relaxes dependencies via facet version-locks, then the
        # child needs to inherit those facets since otherwise it is more
        # constrained in possible solutions than it's parent and likely won't
        # be able to plan an update that keeps it in sync with it's parent.
        #
        # Sine PARENT facets take priority over LOCAL facets, it's possible to
        # have conflicts between the two.  In the case where a facet is both
        # inherited and set locally, both values are preserved, but the
        # inherited value masks the local value.  Users can list and update
        # local values while they are masked using pkg(1), but as long as the
        # values are masked they will not affect image planning operations.
        # Once an inherited facet that masks a local facet is removed, the
        # local facet will be restored.
