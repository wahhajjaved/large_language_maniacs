    '''
    This method will generate a distance matrix between samples
    One for each clade.
    I have been giving some thought as to which level we should be generating these distance matrices on.
    If we do them on the all sequence level, i.e. mixture of clades then we are going to end up with the ordination
    separations based primarily on the presence or absence of clades and this will mask the within clade differences
    Biologically it is more important to be able to tell the difference between within clade different types
    than be able to see if they contain different cladal proportions. After all, SP is about the increased resolution
    So... what I propose is that the researcher do a clade level analysis seperately to look at the differnces between
    clades and then they do ordinations clade by clade.

    Now, with the within-clade analyses we have to chose between ITS2 type profile collection based ordinations
    (i.e. only looking at the sequences contained in a clade_collection_type) or working with all of the sequnces that
    are found within a sample of the given clade. With the former, this will require that the sample has gone through
    an analysis, this is not possible for environmental samples. For coral samples this is of course possible, and we
    would then need to choose about whether you would want to have one clade_collection_type / sample pairing per clade
    collection type or whether you would plot a sample with all of its clade_collection_types plotted. I think the
    latter would be better as this would really be telling the difference between the samples rather than the types
    found within the samples. However, I'm now thinking about the cases where samples are missing one or two DIVs and
    maybe SymPortal hasn't done the best job of resolving the true type they contain. In this case the distance
    should still give a true representation of the similarity of this sample to another sample. Then you might start
    to wonder what the point of the ITS2 type profiles are. Well, they would be to tell us WHAT the types are
    whereas the distance matrix would not be able to do this but give us quantification of similarity. So they would
    in fact be nicely complementary.

    So for the time being, given the above logic, we will work on creating cladally separated distance matrices
    for samples of a given data_set or collection of dataSubmissions. For each sample we will use all sequences
    of the given clade found within the sample to calculate the distances. This will output the distance matrix
    in the outputs folder.

    # 08/12/17 13:41 this is where we're at. We have fixed the cc to initial type dict for the other artefact
    # checking but still need to work on that here as well as the other issues noted below.

    '''
    08/12/17 This is going to cause some problems with the basal comparisons.
    firstly it is assuming that each cct can only associate with  only one type.
    Instead we will just have to make sure to do checks that mean that each cct can only support one type of each
    basal group.
    We will also have to write checks in at the stages where there is a potential for new types to be created.
    It is important that we are checking types according to relative abundances and ratios. We know that this
    information is stored in the types. For more information on this see the comment that is made whwere
    we first create the inital types.

    Although we are unlocking the DIVs that are found at low abundance in the type Assignement this still does
    not enable a lot of CCs to be assigned to the unlocked types even if they meet the requirements of the unlocked
    DIV. This is because they fall outside the acceptable range of one or more of the other DIVs. This is due to
    the fact that these other ranges are still being defined by the inital CCs that are associated to these types.
    To fix this we must reassess the initally associated CCs to every one of the types that contains an artefact DIV.

    For each type currently found, if it contains an artefact div, go through all CCs to see if they fit the normal
    requeirements e.g. >0.03 for each of the DIVs, BUT allow the 0.005 cutoff for the unlocked DIVs. If you find
    a CC that does fit the type, and it is not that CCs current inital type, then assess to see whether the new
    type represents more seqs than the CCs current inital type. If it does, then add it to a list of CCs that will
    need to be added to this type. There is code from the previous 'checkForAdditionalAretfactTypes' that will
    help with this. E.g. collecting all of the CCs first, then goinging type by type for the CCs that need to be
    removed and checking to see if the types are still viable. If they are not, then we need to delete the type
    and rehome the CCs that are hanging. This was also done in the preivous section. At least no new types will
    be being created.

    By this means, more CCs will be able to be associated to the types that contain these artefact DIVs.

    # support one initial type profile. I think we do need to enforce this rule else, you will have really basic
    # types being supported by CCs. e.g. C3 would get loads of support.
    # This could end up being very expensive so I would consider the following work flow to get this working.
    # Have a dictionary that is CC: current initial typeProfile found in. This will need to be kept upto date.
    # Then for each profile we are testing support for, get list of CCs of the clade, go through each CC as
    # before looking to see if there is support. When you find a CC that matches the requirements, look up the
    # type it was found in initially. Then only give support if current type in consideration represents more of its
    # seqs than its current type. If this is so then add this CC to a support type.
    # Once the list of CCs that support has been made, then check to see if support is great enough. If it is then
    # create the new type as before, but now go through each of the CCs and remove it from the type it was previously
    # associated to. Once you have removed it from the type, check to see if they type still has support.

    #10/12/17, I also think we can take the opportunity to move away from working with dataSetSampleSequences

    #09/12/17 This has become unbarably slow. We have an awful lot of redundancy in here that I would like to fix

    '''This will be our latest battle field 07/12/17. We have a problem where we are getting multiple types
    So the object that we're playing around with here is a dictionary with key that is the set of referencesequences
    objects with a value of a 2d list with containing two lists. the first list is the clade collection object that
    this profile was found in. THe second list is the majority sequence of this set in this clade collection
    so if we want to be able to split up these objects to extract e.g. c15 and c3 sets then we'll need to create another
    dictionary entry. So we were probably relying on their only ever being one cladecollection to every set of sequences
    but if we start to do the extractions then were going to end up with multiple clade collections in the dict
    we will also need to be able to calcualate a new maj sequence for each for each of the extracted set of sequences
    we'll then have to see how this might reek havoc further down stream.
    so we end up creating the analysis types from the information that we have created here so
    I don't think that its going to be a problem that we ahve serveral types for a cgiven clade collection as it simply
    means that one clade collection is going to be found listed in multiple types. So lets give it a go!'''

    # We were having problems with the original.
    # The problem was when you have lots of long footprints that have intras in common i.e. D1 and D1a,
    # these long footprints are collapsed all the way down to D1 or D1a, depending on the maj becuase
    # there aren't any footprints that are JUST D1/D1a. So I have a better approach hopefully that will solve this
    # This approach builds on the original collapseFootprints
    # It starts with an n of the longest type and it tries to collapse each of the types into the n-1 types.
    # However, unlike the original, if it fails to collapse into the n-1 it does not then try to collapse into
    # n-2 types etc. Once we have tested all of the n length types and collapsed those that can be we move those that
    # couldn't into a list of unsupported types.
    # We then get all of the sequences found in the footprints of length n and we do itertools to get all n-1 combinations
    # we then try to fit each of these into the unsupported types. We create new footprints in order of the most supported
    # footprints and assign the associted CCs and Maj seqs. Any n length seqs that still don't have a collapse are
    # kept in the unsupported list. This is iterated dropping through the ns. I think this will be great!
    # 1 - check which supported which not, move supported to supportedlist, move unsupported to unsupported lit
    # 2 - for all unsupported check to see if can be collapsed into fooprints of n-1
    #   if can then collapse into and remove type from not supported list
    # 3 - get all n-1 combos of all seqs found in the n-1 unsupported sequences
    # All the seqs found in a CC can now be accessed from the [2] list (third list) of the foorprintList dict value

    '''This will be our latest battle field 07/12/17. We have a problem where we are getting multiple types
    So the object that we're playing around with here is a dictionary with key that is the set of referencesequences
    objects with a value of a 2d list with containing two lists. the first list is the clade collection object that
    this profile was found in. THe second list is the majority sequence of this set in this clade collection
    so if we want to be able to split up these objects to extract e.g. c15 and c3 sets then we'll need to create another
    dictionary entry. So we were probably relying on their only ever being one cladecollection to every set of sequences
    but if we start to do the extractions then were going to end up with multiple clade collections in the dict
    we will also need to be able to calcualate a new maj sequence for each for each of the extracted set of sequences
    we'll then have to see how this might reek havoc further down stream.
    so we end up creating the analysis types from the information that we have created here so
    I don't think that its going to be a problem that we ahve serveral types for a cgiven clade collection as it simply
    means that one clade collection is going to be found listed in multiple types. So lets give it a go!'''

    # We were having problems with the original.
    # The problem was when you have lots of long footprints that have intras in common i.e. D1 and D1a,
    # these long footprints are collapsed all the way down to D1 or D1a, depending on the maj becuase
    # there aren't any footprints that are JUST D1/D1a. So I have a better approach hopefully that will solve this
    # This approach builds on the original collapseFootprints
    # It starts with an n of the longest type and it tries to collapse each of the types into the n-1 types.
    # However, unlike the original, if it fails to collapse into the n-1 it does not then try to collapse into
    # n-2 types etc. Once we have tested all of the n length types and collapsed those that can be we move those that
    # couldn't into a list of unsupported types.
    # We then get all of the sequences found in the footprints of length n and we do itertools to get all n-1 combinations
    # we then try to fit each of these into the unsupported types. We create new footprints in order of the most supported
    # footprints and assign the associted CCs and Maj seqs. Any n length seqs that still don't have a collapse are
    # kept in the unsupported list. This is iterated dropping through the ns. I think this will be great!
    # 1 - check which supported which not, move supported to supportedlist, move unsupported to unsupported lit
    # 2 - for all unsupported check to see if can be collapsed into fooprints of n-1
    #   if can then collapse into and remove type from not supported list
    # 3 - get all n-1 combos of all seqs found in the n-1 unsupported sequences
    # All the seqs found in a CC can now be accessed from the [2] list (third list) of the foorprintList dict value
    # actually I don't think we'll need to caryy around the [2] list as we can simply use the footprint value
    # to get the list of refseqs - duh!
    # see how many footprints have these types, sort by order
    # create new footprints fot these footprints
    # if supported move to supportedlist
    # if not supported move to the non-supporetd list
    # next n...


    # Lists that will hold the footprints that have and do not have support throughout the collapse
    supportedList = []
    unsupportedList = []




    # start with n at the largest footprint in the footprintlist
    # the lowest n that we will work with is 2
    # when we get to the footprints that are two in length we will do the first type of collapsing
    # i.e. we will collapse into existant 1s if feasible but we will not do the combinations
    # section as this will be moot as each will only be one intra big anyway.
    # once we have done the inital collapse of the 2s then we will sort the 1s into
    # supported or unsupported.
    # At this point all of the footprints that were in the footprintList to begin with will be either in
    # the supported or unsupported list
