"""This is Gratipay's payday algorithm.

Exchanges (moving money between Gratipay and the outside world) and transfers
(moving money amongst Gratipay users) happen within an isolated event called
payday. This event has duration (it's not punctiliar).

Payday is designed to be crash-resistant. Everything that can be rolled back
happens inside a single DB transaction. Exchanges cannot be rolled back, so they
immediately affect the participant's balance.
