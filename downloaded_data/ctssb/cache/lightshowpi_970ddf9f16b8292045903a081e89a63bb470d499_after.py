"""Play any audio file and synchronize lights to the music

When executed, this script will play an audio file, as well as turn on and off N channels
of lights to the music (by default the first 8 GPIO channels on the Rasberry Pi), based upon
music it is playing. Many types of audio files are supported (see decoder.py below), but
it has only been tested with wav and mp3 at the time of this writing.

The timing of the lights turning on and off is based upon the frequency response of the music
being played.  A short segment of the music is analyzed via FFT to get the frequency response
across each defined channel in the audio range.  Each light channel is then faded in and out based
upon the amplitude of the frequency response in the corresponding audio channel.  Fading is 
accomplished with a software PWM output.  Each channel can also be configured to simply turn on
and off as the frequency response in the corresponding channel crosses a threshold.

FFT calculation can be CPU intensive and in some cases can adversely affect playback of songs
(especially if attempting to decode the song as well, as is the case for an mp3).  For this reason,
the FFT cacluations are cached after the first time a new song is played.  The values are cached
in a gzip'd text file in the same location as the song itself.  Subsequent requests to play the
same song will use the cached information and not recompute the FFT, thus reducing CPU utilization
dramatically and allowing for clear music playback of all audio file types.

Recent optimizations have improved this dramatically and most users are no longer reporting
adverse playback of songs even on the first playback.

Sample usage:
To play an entire list -
sudo python synchronized_lights.py --playlist=/home/pi/music/.playlist

To play a specific song -
sudo python synchronized_lights.py --file=/home/pi/music/jingle_bells.mp3
