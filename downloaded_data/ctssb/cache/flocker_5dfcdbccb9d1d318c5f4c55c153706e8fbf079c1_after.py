"""
Communication protocol between control service and convergence agent.

The cluster is composed of a control service server, and convergence
agents. The code below implicitly assumes convergence agents are
node-specific, but that will likely change and involve additinal commands.

Interactions:

* The control service knows the desired configuration for the cluster.
  Every time the configuration changes the control service notifies the
  convergence agents using the ``ClusterStatusCommand``.

* The convergence agents can determine part of the state of the cluster
  (usually their own local state).  Whenever node state changes they notify
  the control service with a ``NodeStateCommand``.

* The control service caches the most recent state from all nodes.  Whenever
  the control service receives an update to the state of a specific node via a
  ``NodeStateCommand``, the control service integrates that update into a
  cluster-wide state representation (the state of all of the nodes) and sends a
  ``ClusterStatusCommand`` to all convergence agents.

Eliot contexts are transferred along with AMP commands, allowing tracing
of logged actions across processes (see
http://eliot.readthedocs.org/en/0.6.0/threads.html).

:var _caching_encoder: ``CachingEncoder`` used by
    ``SerializableArgument``, allowing for cached serialization.
