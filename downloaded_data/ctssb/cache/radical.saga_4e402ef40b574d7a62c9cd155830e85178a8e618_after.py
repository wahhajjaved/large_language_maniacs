class TimeoutGC (object) :
    """
    This class supports a timout driven garbage collection.  A monitored object
    instance can register itself with this garbage collector (a singleton), and
    update its timer whenever it is active.  When being inactive for a while,
    the GC will call finalize() on the object.  The object can notify the gc of
    ongoing activities -- this will (a) reset the timer, and (b) the gc will
    ensure that the object is in a viable state for the activity -- i.e. it will
    call the object's ``initialize()`` method if it timed out before.

    Note that the finalize() is called in a separate thread.  The time granularity
    is 10 seconds -- i.e. the thread checks for idle objects every 10 seconds.

    Usage::

      import time
      import saga.utils.timeout_gc as togc
      
      class WatchedClass () :
      
        def __init__ (self) :
      
          print "ctor"
          self.initialize ()
      
          self.gc = togc.TimeoutGC ()
          self.gc.register (self, self.initialize, self.finalize, timeout=5)
      
        def __del__ (self) :
          print "dtor"
          self.gc.unregister (self)
          self.finalize ()
          pass
      
        def initialize (self) :
          print "init"
          self.f = open('/tmp/watched.txt', 'a+')
          self.f.write ("init\\n")
      
        def finalize (self) :
          print "fini"
          self.f.write ("fini\\n")
          self.f.close ()
      
        def action (self) :
          with self.gc.active (self) :
            print "action"
            self.f.write ("action\\n")
      
      # main
      wc = WatchedClass ()
      wc.action ()
      time.sleep (20)
      wc.action ()

    This will print::

      ctor
      init
      action
      fini
      init
      action
      fini
      dtor

    (The last 'fini' and 'dtor' messages are likely missing while python
    shuts down).

    The ``sleep(20)`` will cause the ``TimeoutGC``  to call the ``finalize()``
    method of the watched class.  On the next action after the sleep, the ``with
    self.gc.active (self)`` statement will ensure that the object is alive
    again -- the ``TimeoutGC`` will call the object's ``initialize()`` method.


    Known Limitations:
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      * Objects which register in the garbage collector are never removed unless
        they unregister.  This can potentially lead to memory starvation, as the
        native Python garbage collector will not be able to reclaim those
        objects.  Thus: unregister on ``__del__``!

      * When an object's ``finalize()`` is called, due to an timeout, and that
        method raises an exception, the ``TimeoutGC`` still assumes that the
        object is dead, and will potentially attempt to revive it.  It is the
        responsibility of the watched object to handle that condition.

    class _Activity (object) :
        """ This is an activity context manager -- it gets created by
        timeout_gc.active(obj), and on creation locks the object's lock.  The
        __enter__ method thus does not need to lock again, but the __exit__
        method must do so.  

        This makes it imperative that the ``active()`` method is ALWAYS called in
        a ``with`` statement (or, more exactly, that the ``_Activity`` instances
        returned by ``active()`` are always used in a ``with`` statement --
        otherwise the lock gets never unlocked (well, ``__del__`` tries to
        mitigate that, but anyway).
