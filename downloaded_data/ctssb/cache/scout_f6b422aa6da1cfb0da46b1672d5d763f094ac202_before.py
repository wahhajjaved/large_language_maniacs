        Note:
            The 'markets' attribute of an individual measure to be merged
            into a package includes partitioning fractions needed to breakout
            the measure's output markets/savings by key variables (e.g.,
            climate zone, building type, end use, etc.). These fractions are
            based on the portion of the measure's total energy use market that
            is attributable to each breakout variable (e.g., 50% of the
            measure's total energy market is attributed to the heating end
            use). This function unnormalizes the measure's breakout fractions
            and adds the resultant energy use sub-market to a new set of
            breakout information for a measure package. Output breakout dicts
            must be identically structured for the merge to work.
