"""
Sets up base Python development environments used by this project.

These are the Python environments from which multiple virtual environments can
then be spawned as needed.

The environments should have the following Python packages installed:
  * setuptools (for installing pip)
  * pip (for installing everything except itself)
  * pytest (for running the project's test suite)
  * six (Python 2/3 compatibility layer used in the project's test suite)
  * virtualenv (for creating virtual Python environments)
plus certain specific Python versions may require additional backward
compatibility support packages.

"""
#TODO: Python 3.4.0 comes with setuptools & pip preinstalled but they can be
# installed and/or upgraded manually if needed so we choose not to use their
# built-in installations, i.e. the built-in ensurepip module. Consider using
# the built-in ensurepip module if regular setuptools/pip installation fails
# for some reason or has been configured to run locally.
#TODO: logging
#TODO: command-line option support
#TODO: support for additional configuration files, e.g. ones that are developer
# or development environment specific.
#TODO: warn if multiple environments use the same executable
#TODO: make the script importable
#TODO: report when the installed package version is newer than the last tested
# one
#TODO: hold a list of last tested package versions and report a warning if a
# newer one is encountered
#  > # Where no Python package version has been explicitly specified, the
#  > # following 'currently latest available' package release has been
#  > # successfully used:
#  > "last tested package version": {
#  >     "argparse": "1.2.1",
#  >     "backports.ssl_match_hostname": "3.4.0.2",
#  >     "colorama": "0.3.1",
#  >     "pip": "1.5.5",
#  >     "py": "1.4.20",
#  >     "pytest": "2.5.2",
#  >     "setuptools": "3.6",
#  >     "virtualenv": "1.11.5"},
#TODO: automated checking for new used package versions, e.g. using PyPI XRC
# API:
#  > import xmlrpc.client as xrc
#  > client = xrc.ServerProxy("http://pypi.python.org/pypi")
#  > client.package_releases("six")  # just the latest release
#  > client.package_releases("six", True)  # all releases
#TODO: option to break on bad environments
#TODO: verbose option to report bad environment detection output
#TODO: verbose option to report all environment detection output
#TODO: verbose option to report environment details
#TODO: Consider running the environment scanner script from an empty temporary
# folder to avoid importing random same-named modules from the current working
# folder. An alternative would be to play around with sys.path in the scanner
# script, e.g. remove its first element. Also, we might want to clear out any
# globally set Python environment variables such as PYTHONPATH.
#TODO: collect stdout, stderr & log outputs for each easy_install/pip run
#TODO: configurable - avoid downloads if a suitable locally downloaded source
# is available (ez_setup, setuptools, pip)
#TODO: 244 downloads must come before 243 installation
#TODO: support configuring what latest suitable version we want to use if
# available in the following layers:
#  - already installed
#  - local installation cache (can not find out the latest available content,
#    can only download to it or install from it)
#  - pypi
# related configuration options:
#  - allow already installed,
#  - allow locally downloaded,
#  - allow pypi
#TODO: if you want better local-cache support - use devpi:
#  - better caching support and version detection
#  - devpi & pypi usage transparent
#  - we'll need a script for installing & setting up the devpi server
#TODO: parallelization
#TODO: concurrency support - file locking required for:
# installation cache folder:
#   downloading (write)
#   zipping eggs (write)
#   installing from local folder (read)
# Python environment installation area:
#   installing new packages (write)
#   running Python code (read)
#TODO: test whether we can upgrade pip in-place
#TODO: test how we can make pip safe to use when there are multiple pip based
# installations being run at the same time by the same user - specify some
# global folders, like the temp build folder, explicitly
#TODO: Detect most recent packages on PyPI, but do that at most once in a
# single script run, or with a separate script, or use devpi. Currently, if a
# suitable package is found locally, a more suitable one will not be checked
# for on PyPI.
#TODO: Recheck error handling to make sure all failed commands are correctly
# detected. Some might not set a non-0 exit code on error and so their output
# must be used as a success/failure indicator.

    The following Python versions are not affected by this issue:
      Python 2.4 - use setuptools 1.4.2 - installs itself as a non-zipped egg
      Python 2.6+ - use setuptools versions not affected by this issue
    That just leaves Python versions 2.5.x to worry about.

    This problem occurs because of an internal stale cache issue causing the
    upgrade to read data from the new zip archive at a location calculated
    based on the original zip archive's content, effectively causing such read
    operations to either succeed (if read content had not changed its
    location), fail with a 'bad local header' exception or even fail silently
    and return incorrect data.

    To avoid the issue, we explicitly uninstall the previously installed
    setuptools distribution before installing its new version.
