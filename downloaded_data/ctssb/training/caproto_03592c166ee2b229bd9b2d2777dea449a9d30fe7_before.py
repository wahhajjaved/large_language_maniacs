# This module defines two classes that encapsulate key abstractions in
# Channel Access: Channels and VirtualCircuits. Each VirtualCircuit is a
# companion to a (user-managed) TCP socket, updating its state in response to
# incoming and outgoing TCP bytestreams. A third class, the Hub, owns these
# VirtualCircuits and spawns new ones as needed. The Hub updates its state in
# response to incoming and outgoing UDP datagrams.
