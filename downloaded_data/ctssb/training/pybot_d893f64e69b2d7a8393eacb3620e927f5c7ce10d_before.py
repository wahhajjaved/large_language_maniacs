  """
  Allows event type definition. The definition accepts a regex.
  Every event can be triggered by specific lines, messages, message_id or users.
  Eventually (see time_event branch for proof-of-concept implementation) time-sensitive events will be triggerable as well.

  Each line received by the bot is passed to each module in the modules_list. If the module determines the line matches what the event cares about,
  the event calls each of its subscribers itself, which contains all the information the module needs to respond appropriately.

  To use:
    e = Event("__my_type__")
    e.define("some_regex")
