#
#	Welcome to webXray!
#
#	This program needs the following to run:
#		Python 3.4 				https://www.python.org
#		phantomjs 1.9+ 			http://phantomjs.org
#		MySQL					https://www.mysql.com
#		MySQL Python Connector	https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/ (go with platform independent)
#	
#	webXray will try to alert you to failed dependencies, so if you are having
#	 issues make sure above is installed
#
#	This file is may be all you are ever be exposed to.  It has an interactive mode
#		'-i' which is what most people will need for small to moderate sets of pages (eg < 10k).
#		However, if you are doing big sets you may want to use the unattended options '-c' and '-a'.
#		Run with '-h' for details.
#
#	An important option to set is pool_size which determines how many parallel processes are run,
#		 look at the collect() function for details and to adjust.
#

# before anything test we are on right version of python!

	#	('pool_size' being the number of parallel processes are run)
	#  on small sets you can leave it at '1' and it will be slow, but very stable
	#  on larger sets you should consider upping the pool_size to speed up your collection
	#  and fully leverage your resources
	#
	# the real limit on performance here is that phantomjs is a web browser, so uses lots of 
	#	cpu and mem
	#
	# roughly speaking, it is generally safe to run 4 concurrent processes for each GB of memory
	#	eg: 
	#		4gb = pool_size 16
	#		8gb = pool_size 32
	#
	# of course local performance may vary, so tuning this variable is advised if pushing
	#  over 1M pages - and if you are doing over 1M you should be tuning mysql as well!
	#
	# a sign your pool is too big is if the % of pages with 3p request goes way down - this 
	#	means network requests are being fired off or completed and you are losing data
	#
	# the best way to play with this is start low and do a run of 500 pages, then increment x2
	#	until your numbers start to go down, then ease back
