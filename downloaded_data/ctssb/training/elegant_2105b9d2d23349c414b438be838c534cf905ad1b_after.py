def scan_experiment_dir(experiment_root, channels='bf', timepoint_filter=None, image_ext='png'):
    """Read files from a 'worm corral' experiment for further processing or analysis.

    Directory structure is assumed to be an experimental directory, with one or
    more position directories within. Inside each position directory are image
    files, where each image filename begins with a timepoint name (usually an
    ISO timestamp), followed by a space, and then a channel name for that
    timepoint. Each image file ends with an extension, ususally .png or .tif.

    Graphically:
    EXP_DIR/
        POS1/
            TIMEPOINT1 CHANNEL1.EXT
            TIMEPOINT1 CHANNEL2.EXT
            TIMEPOINT2 CHANNEL1.EXT
            TIMEPOINT2 CHANNEL2.EXT
            ...
        POS2/
            TIMEPOINT1 CHANNEL1.EXT
            TIMEPOINT1 CHANNEL2.EXT
            TIMEPOINT2 CHANNEL1.EXT
            TIMEPOINT2 CHANNEL2.EXT
            ...
        ...

    If multiple channels are specified, they will be loaded as image layer
    stacks.

    Parameters:
        experiment_root: the path to an experimental directory.
        channels: list/tuple of image channels to load for each timepoint, or
            a single channel as a string. If None, return all channels found.
        timepoint_filter: if not None, this must be a function defined as:
            timepoint_filter(position_name, timepoint_name) -> bool
            This function takes the position name and the timepoint name, and
            returns True or False, depending on whether to load those images.
            This can be used to only load a range of positions or timepoints.
            If no timepoints pass the filter for a given position, then that
            position will not be present in the returned dictionary.
        image_ext: the image filename extension.

    Returns: an ordered dictionary mapping position names to position dicts,
        where each position dict is another ordered dictionary mapping timepoint
        names to a list of image files, one image file per channel requested.
        Positions with no timepoints, or whose timepoints were all excluded by
        the filter, will not be present in the dictionary.

    Examples of using timepoint_filter:

    To load only images after a certain date:
        positions = read_annotations('path/to/experiment')
        def timepoint_filter(position_name, timepoint_name):
            return timepoint_name > '2017-07-05'
        files = scan_experiment_directory(experiment_directory,
            timepoint_filter=timepoint_filter)

    To load only positions that weren't previously annotated as "exclude":
        experiment_root = 'path/to/experiment'
        positions = read_annotations(experiment_root)
        good_positions = filter_annotations(positions, filter_excluded)

            return position_name in good_positions
        files = scan_experiment_directory(experiment_root, timepoint_filter=timepoint_filter)

            just as returned by read_annotations &c.)
            The function must return a bool or a list of bools. If a bool is
            returned, the whole position will be included; if a list of bools,
            then only the timepoints for which matching list entry is True will
            be included.

    Returns: OrderedDict of the subset of supplied positions/timepoints for
        which position_filter returned True.

    Examples:
    Basic usage: read in a position dict, define a position_filter function, and
    then call filter_annotations(). Sample example position_filter functions are below.

        positions = read_annotations('/path/to/exp/root')

        def position_filter(position_name, position_annotations, timepoint_annotations):
            return position_annotations.get('exclude', True) # if not present, assume not excluded

    To exclude based on whether a string appears or not in the "notes" field:
        def position_filter(position_name, position_annotations, timepoint_annotations):
            return 'bagged' not in position_annotations.get('notes', '')

    To get only worms that have not been fully annotated with life-stages:
        def position_filter(position_name, position_annotations, timepoint_annotations):
            stages = [tp.get('stage') for tp in timepoint_annotations.values()]
            # NB: all(stages) below is True iff there is a non-None, non-empty-string
            # annotation for each stage.
            done = all(stages) and stages[-1] == 'dead'
            return not done

    Several useful filters are pre-defined in this module as filter_*. For example,
    filter_excluded() excludes all positions with the "exclude" keyword set, just
    as above. It's simple to use that filter:
