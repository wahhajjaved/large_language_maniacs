def filter_owner_name(queryset, search):
    """Filter by first name / last name of the owner.

    This filter is a bit tricky, so an explanation is due.

    The main purpose of the filter is to:
    a) Use the `filter_name` function of `users` module to find all
       the users whose name matches the search query.
    b) Use the UUIDs of the filtered users to retrieve all the entities that
       belong to them.

    What we should have in mind is that the (a) query can be a rather expensive
    one. However, the main issue here is the (b) query. For this query, a
    naive approach would be to use Q objects like so:

        Q(userid=1ae43...) | Q(userid=23bc...) | Q(userid=7be8...) | ...

    Straightforward as it may be, Django will not optimize the above expression
    into one operation but will query the database recursively. In practice, if
    the first query hasn't narrowed down the users to less than a thousand,
    this query will surely blow the stack of the database thread.

    Given that all Q objects refer to the same database field, we can bypass
    them and use the "__in" operator.  With "__in" we can pass a list of values
    (uuids in our case) as a filter argument. Moreover, we can simplify things
    a bit more by passing the queryset of (a) as the argument of "__in".  In
    Postgres, this will create a subquery, which nullifies the need to evaluate
    the results of (a) in memory and then pass them to (b).

    Warning: Querying a database using a subquery for another database has not
    been tested yet.
