    A Query subclass which optionally loads full results from cache.

    The CachingQuery optionally stores additional state that allows it to
    consult a cache before accessing the database, in the form of a FromCache
    or RelationshipCache object.

    Each of these objects refer to a cache. When such an object has associated
    itself with the CachingQuery, it is used to locate a cached result.
    If none is present, then the Query is invoked normally, the results
    being cached.
