    MULTICOM is an algorithm for detecting multiple local communities, possibly overlapping, by expanding the initial seed set.
    This algorithm uses local scoring metrics to define an embedding of the graph around the seed set. Based on this embedding, it picks new seeds in the neighborhood of the original seed set, and uses these new seeds to recover multiple communities.

    BigClam is an overlapping community detection method that scales to large networks.
    The model has three main ingredients:
    1)The node community memberships are represented with a bipartite affiliation network that links nodes of the social network to communities that they belong to.
    2)People tend to be involved in communities to various degrees. Therefore,  each affiliation edge in the bipartite affiliation network has a nonnegative weight. The higher the node’s weight of the affiliation to the community the more likely is the node to be connected to other members in the community.
    3)When people share multiple community affiliations, the links between them stem for one dominant reason. This means that for each community a pair of nodes shares we get an independent chance of connecting the nodes. Thus, naturally, the more communities a pair of nodes shares, the higher the probability of being connected.
