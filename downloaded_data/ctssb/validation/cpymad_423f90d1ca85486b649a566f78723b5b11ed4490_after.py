"""
RPC service module for libmadx.

This module is needed to execute several instances of the `libmadx` module
in remote processes and communicate with them via remote procedure calls
(RPC). Use the :meth:`LibMadxClient.spawn` to create a new instance.


CAUTION:

The service communicates with the remote end via pickling, i.e. both ends
can execute arbitrary code on the other side. This means that the remote
process can not be used to safely execute unsafe commands.
