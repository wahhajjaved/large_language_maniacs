    <!--- Copied Spiel from NodeDetail -->

    On the front end, nodes are considered 'projects' or 'components'. The difference between a project and a component
    is that a project is the top-level node, and components are children of the project. There is also a [category
    field](/v2/#osf-node-categories) that includes 'project' as an option. The categorization essentially determines
    which icon is displayed by the node in the front-end UI and helps with search organization. Top-level nodes may have
    a category other than project, and children nodes may have a category of project.

    ###Creating New Nodes

        Method:        POST
        URL:           /links/self
        Query Params:  <none>
        Body (JSON):   {
                         "data": {
                           "type": "nodes", # required
                           "attributes": {
                             "title":         {title},          # required
                             "category":      {category},       # required
                             "description":   {description},    # optional

                             "template_from": {node_id}         # optional
                           }
                         }
                       }
        Success:       201 CREATED + node representation

    New nodes are created by issuing a POST request to this endpoint.  The `title` and `category` fields are
    mandatory. `category` must be one of the [permitted node categories](/v2/#osf-node-categories).  `public` defaults
    to false.  All other fields not listed above will be ignored.  If the node creation is successful the API will
    return a 201 response with the representation of the new node in the body.  For the new node's canonical URL, see
    the `/links/self` field of the response.

    ##Query Params

    + `page=<Int>` -- page number of results to view, default 1

    + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search results on.

    + `view_only=<Str>` -- Allow users with limited access keys to access this node. Note that some keys are anonymous,
    so using the view_only key will cause user-related information to no longer serialize. This includes blank ids for
    users and contributors and missing serializer fields and relationships.

    Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`,
    `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.  Most are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching.  `public`
    is a boolean, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, or `1`.  Note that quoting `true`
    or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail regardless.  `tags` is an array of simple strings.

    On the front end, nodes are considered 'projects' or 'components'. The difference between a project and a component
    is that a project is the top-level node, and components are children of the project. There is also a [category
    field](/v2/#osf-node-categories) that includes 'project' as an option. The categorization essentially determines

    a category other than project, and children nodes may have a category of project.

    ###Permissions

    Nodes that are made public will give read-only access to everyone. Private nodes require explicit read
    permission. Write and admin access are the same for public and private nodes. Administrators on a parent node have
    implicit read permissions for all child nodes.

    To update a node, issue either a PUT or a PATCH request against the `/links/self` URL.  The `title` and `category`
    fields are mandatory if you PUT and optional if you PATCH.  The `tags` parameter must be an array of strings.
    Non-string values will be accepted and stringified, but we make no promises about the stringification output.  So
    don't do that.

    ###Delete

        URL:      /links/self
        Params:   <none>
        Success:  204 No Content

    To delete a node, issue a DELETE request against `/links/self`.  A successful delete will return a 204 No Content
    response. Attempting to delete a node you do not own will result in a 403 Forbidden.

        Success:       201 CREATED + node contributor representation

    Add a contributor to a node by issuing a POST request to this endpoint.  This effectively creates a relationship
    between the node and the user.  Besides the top-level type, there are optional "attributes" which describe the
    relationship between the node and the user. `bibliographic` is a boolean and defaults to `true`.  `permission` must
    be a [valid OSF permission key](/v2/#osf-node-permission-keys) and defaults to `"write"`.  A relationship object
    with a "data" member, containing the user `type` and user `id` must be included.  The id must be a valid user id.
    All other fields not listed above will be ignored.  If the request is successful the API will return
    a 201 response with the representation of the new node contributor in the body.  For the new node contributor's
    canonical URL, see the `/links/self` field of the response.

    ##Query Params

    + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search results on.

    NodeContributors may be filtered by `bibliographic`, or `permission` attributes.  `bibliographic` is a boolean, and
    can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, or `1`.  Note that quoting `true` or `false` in
    the query will cause the match to fail regardless.

    + `profile_image_size=<Int>` -- Modifies `/links/profile_image_url` of the user entities so that it points to
    the user's profile image scaled to the given size in pixels.  If left blank, the size depends on the image provider.

    Registrations are read-only snapshots of a project that can never be edited or deleted but can be withdrawn. This view
    is a list of all the registrations and withdrawn registrations of the current node. To create a registration, first
    create a draft registration and answer the required supplemental registration questions. Then, submit a POST request
    to this endpoint with the draft registration id in the body of the request.

    A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information, namely, title, description,
    date_created, registration, withdrawn, date_registered, withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All
    other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only relationships permitted to be accessed for a withdrawn
    registration are the contributors - other relationships will return a 403. Each resource contains the full representation
    of the registration, meaning additional requests to an individual registrations's detail view are not necessary.

    To create a registration, issue a POST request to the `self` link.  'draft_registration' must be the id of a completed
    draft registration created for the current node.  All required supplemental questions in the draft registration must
    have been answered. Registration choice should be 'embargo' if you wish to add an embargo date to the registration.
    Registrations can have embargo periods for up to four years. 'lift_embargo' should be the embargo end date.
    When the embargo expires, the registration will be made public. If 'immediate' is selected as the "registration_choice",
    the registration will be made public once it is approved.

    Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`,
    `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.  Most are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching.  `public`
    is a boolean, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, or `1`.  Note that quoting `true`
    or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail regardless.  `tags` is an array of simple strings.

                    }
        Success: 201 CREATED + node representation

    To create a fork of the current node, issue a POST request to this endpoint.  The `title` field is optional, with the
    default title being 'Fork of ' + the current node's title. If the fork's creation is successful the API will return a
    201 response with the representation of the forked node in the body. For the new fork's canonical URL, see the `/links/self`
    field of the response.

    Nodes may be filtered by their `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `registration`, `tags`, `date_created`,
    `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`. Most are string fields and will be filtered using simple
    substring matching.  Others are booleans, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, or `1`.
    Note that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail regardless. `tags` is an array of simple strings.

    ##File Attributes

    <!--- Copied Attributes from FileDetail -->

    For an OSF File entity, the `type` is "files" regardless of whether the entity is actually a file or folder.  They
    can be distinguished by the `kind` attribute.  Files and folders use the same representation, but some attributes may
    be null for one kind but not the other. `size` will be null for folders.  A list of storage provider keys can be
    found [here](/v2/#storage-providers).

        name          type               description
        ===================================================================================================
        guid              string             OSF GUID for this file (if one has been assigned)

                                             OSF.  other examples include "s3" for Amazon S3, "googledrive"
                                             for Google Drive, "box" for Box.com.

                                             applies to non-OSF storage providers.

            sha256        string             SHA-256 hash of file, null for folders

    * A note on timestamps: for files stored in osfstorage, `date_created` refers to the time the file was
    first uploaded to osfstorage, and `date_modified` is the time the file was last updated while in osfstorage.
    Other providers may or may not provide this information, but if they do it will correspond to the provider's
    semantics for created/modified times.  These timestamps may also be stale; metadata retrieved via the File Detail
    endpoint is cached.  The `last_touched` field describes the last time the metadata was retrieved from the external
    provider.  To force a metadata update, access the parent folder via its Node Files List endpoint.

    ##Links

    See the [JSON-API spec regarding pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-pagination).

    ##Actions

    <!--- Copied from FileDetail.Actions -->

    The `links` property of the response provides endpoints for common file operations. The currently-supported actions
    are:

    ###Get Info (*files, folders*)

        Method:   GET
        URL:      /links/info
        Params:   <none>
        Success:  200 OK + file representation

    The contents of a folder or details of a particular file can be retrieved by performing a GET request against the
    `info` link. The response will be a standard OSF response format with the [OSF File attributes](#attributes).

    ###Download (*files*)

        Method:   GET
        URL:      /links/download
        Params:   <none>
        Success:  200 OK + file body

    To download a file, issue a GET request against the `download` link.  The response will have the Content-Disposition
    header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser.

    ###Create Subfolder (*folders*)

        Method:       PUT
        URL:          /links/new_folder
        Query Params: ?kind=folder&name={new_folder_name}
        Body:         <empty>
        Success:      201 Created + new folder representation

    You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the `new_folder` link.  The
    `?kind=folder` portion of the query parameter is already included in the `new_folder` link.  The name of the new
    subfolder should be provided in the `name` query parameter.  The response will contain a [WaterButler folder
    entity](#folder-entity).  If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return
    a 409 Conflict error response.

    ###Upload New File (*folders*)

        Method:       PUT
        URL:          /links/upload
        Query Params: ?kind=file&name={new_file_name}
        Body (Raw):   <file data (not form-encoded)>
        Success:      201 Created + new file representation

    To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's `upload` link with the raw file data in the
    request body, and the `kind` and `name` query parameters set to `'file'` and the desired name of the file.  The
    response will contain a [WaterButler file entity](#file-entity) that describes the new file.  If a file with the
    same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.

    ###Update Existing File (*file*)

        Method:       PUT
        URL:          /links/upload
        Query Params: ?kind=file
        Body (Raw):   <file data (not form-encoded)>
        Success:      200 OK + updated file representation

    To update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's `upload` link with the raw file data in the request
    body and the `kind` query parameter set to `"file"`.  The update action will create a new version of the file.
    The response will contain a [WaterButler file entity](#file-entity) that describes the updated file.

    ###Rename (*files, folders*)

        Method:        POST
        URL:           /links/move
        Query Params:  <none>
        Body (JSON):   {
                        "action": "rename",
                        "rename": {new_file_name}
                       }
        Success:       200 OK + new entity representation

    To rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the `move` link with the `action` body parameter set to
    `"rename"` and the `rename` body parameter set to the desired name.  The response will contain either a folder
    entity or file entity with the new name.

    ###Move & Copy (*files, folders*)

        Method:        POST
        URL:           /links/move
        Query Params:  <none>
        Body (JSON):   {
                        // mandatory
                        "action":   "move"|"copy",
                        "path":     {path_attribute_of_target_folder},
                        // optional
                        "rename":   {new_name},
                        "conflict": "replace"|"keep", // defaults to 'replace'
                        "resource": {node_id},        // defaults to current {node_id}
                        "provider": {provider}        // defaults to current {provider}
                       }
        Success:       200 OK or 201 Created + new entity representation

    Move and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the `move` url, but with different values for
    the `action` body parameters.  The `path` parameter is also required and should be the OSF `path` attribute of the
    folder being written to.  The `rename` and `conflict` parameters are optional.  If you wish to change the name of
    the file or folder at its destination, set the `rename` parameter to the new name.  The `conflict` param governs how
    name clashes are resolved.  Possible values are `replace` and `keep`.  `replace` is the default and will overwrite
    the file that already exists in the target folder.  `keep` will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new
    file's name until it no longer conflicts.  The suffix will be ' (**x**)' where **x** is a increasing integer
    starting from 1.  This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder.  The response will contain either a
    folder entity or file entity with the new name.

    Files and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers.  The `resource` parameter is the id of the node
    under which the file/folder should be moved.  It *must* agree with the `path` parameter, that is the `path` must
    identify a valid folder under the node identified by `resource`.  Likewise, the `provider` parameter may be used to
    move the file/folder to another storage provider, but both the `resource` and `path` parameters must belong to a
    node and folder already extant on that provider.  Both `resource` and `provider` default to the current node and
    providers.

    If a moved/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned.  Otherwise, a 201
    Created will be returned.

    ###Delete (*file, folders*)

        Method:        DELETE
        URL:           /links/delete
        Query Params:  <none>
        Success:       204 No Content

    To delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the `delete` link.  Nothing will be returned in the response
    body.

    ##Query Params

    + `page=<Int>` -- page number of results to view, default 1

    + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search results on.

    Node files may be filtered by `id`, `name`, `node`, `kind`, `path`, `provider`, `size`, and `last_touched`.

    To update a node, issue either a PUT or a PATCH request against the `/links/self` URL.  The `external_account_id`,
    `enabled`, and `folder_id` fields are mandatory if you PUT and optional if you PATCH. However, at least one is always mandatory.
    Non-string values will be accepted and stringified, but we make no promises about the stringification output.  So
    don't do that.

    To delete or deauthorize a node_addon, issue a PUT with all fields set to `null` / `False`, or a PATCH with `enabled` set to `False`.

    ####Note

    Not all addons are currently configurable via the API. The current list of addons that accept PUT/PATCH is [`box`, `dropbox`, `s3`, `googledrive`]

    Users of the OSF may access their data on a [number of cloud-storage](/v2/#storage-providers) services that have
    integrations with the OSF.  We call these "providers".  By default every node has access to the OSF-provided
    storage but may use as many of the supported providers as desired.  This endpoint lists all of the providers that are
    configured for this node.  If you want to add more, you will need to do that in the Open Science Framework front end
    for now.

    In the OSF filesystem model, providers are treated as folders, but with special properties that distinguish them
    from regular folders.  Every provider folder is considered a root folder, and may not be deleted through the regular
    file API.  To see the contents of the provider, issue a GET request to the `/relationships/files/links/related/href`
    attribute of the provider resource.  The `new_folder` and `upload` actions are handled by another service called
    WaterButler, whose response format differs slightly from the OSF's.

    You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the `new_folder` link.  The
    `?kind=folder` portion of the query parameter is already included in the `new_folder` link.  The name of the new
    subfolder should be provided in the `name` query parameter.  The response will contain a [WaterButler folder
    entity](#folder-entity).  If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return
    a 409 Conflict error response.

    ###Upload New File (*folders*)

        Method:       PUT

    To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's `upload` link with the raw file data in the
    request body, and the `kind` and `name` query parameters set to `'file'` and the desired name of the file.  The
    response will contain a [WaterButler file entity](#file-entity) that describes the new file.  If a file with the
    same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.

    To create a comment on this node, issue a POST request against this endpoint. The comment target id and target type
    must be specified. To create a comment on the node overview page, the target `type` would be "nodes" and the `id`
    would be the node id. To reply to a comment on this node, the target `type` would be "comments" and the `id` would
    be the id of the comment to reply to. The `content` field is mandatory.

    If the comment creation is successful the API will return
    a 201 response with the representation of the new comment in the body. For the new comment's canonical URL, see the
    `/links/self` field of the response.

    ##Query Params

    + `filter[deleted]=True|False` -- filter comments based on whether or not they are deleted.

    The list of node comments includes deleted comments by default. The `deleted` field is a boolean and can be
    filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, or `1`. Note that quoting `true` or `false` in
    the query will cause the match to fail regardless.

    + `filter[date_created][comparison_operator]=YYYY-MM-DDTH:M:S` -- filter comments based on date created.

    Comments can also be filtered based on their `date_created` and `date_modified` fields. Possible comparison
    operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte'
    (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.

    + `filter[target]=target_id` -- filter comments based on their target id.

    The list of comments can be filtered by target id. For example, to get all comments with target = project,
    the target_id would be the project_id.

    Linked nodes are the nodes pointed to by node links. This view will probably replace node_links in the near future.

    <!--- Copied Spiel from NodeDetail -->

    On the front end, nodes are considered 'projects' or 'components'. The difference between a project and a component
    is that a project is the top-level node, and components are children of the project. There is also a [category
    field](/v2/#osf-node-categories) that includes 'project' as an option. The categorization essentially determines
    which icon is displayed by the node in the front-end UI and helps with search organization. Top-level nodes may have
    a category other than project, and children nodes may have a category of project.

    ##Linked Node Attributes

    <!--- Copied Attributes from NodeDetail -->

    OSF Node entities have the "nodes" `type`.

        category       string             node category, must be one of the allowed values
        date_created   iso8601 timestamp  timestamp that the node was created
        date_modified  iso8601 timestamp  timestamp when the node was last updated

    ##Query Params

    + `page=<Int>` -- page number of results to view, default 1

    + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search results on.

    Nodes may be filtered by their `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `registration`, or `tags`.  `title`,
    `description`, and `category` are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching.  `public` and
    `registration` are booleans, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, or `1`.  Note
    that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail regardless.  `tags` is an array of simple strings.
