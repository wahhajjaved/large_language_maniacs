    """
    Generator that takes the expected output of a merge, a user
    algorithm, a trading environment, and a simulator style as
    arguments.  Pipes the merge stream through a TransactionSimulator
    and a PerformanceTracker, which keep track of the current state of
    our algorithm's simulated universe. Results are fed to the user's
    algorithm, which directly inserts transactions into the
    TransactionSimulator's order book.

    TransactionSimulator maintains a dictionary from sids to the
    unfulfilled orders placed by the user's algorithm.  As trade
    events arrive, if the algorithm has open orders against the
    trade's sid, the simulator will fill orders up to 25% of market
    cap.  Applied transactions are added to a txn field on the event
    and forwarded to PerformanceTracker. The txn field is set to None
    on non-trade events and events that do not match any open orders.

    PerformanceTracker receives the updated event messages from
    TransactionSimulator, maintaining a set of daily and cumulative
    performance metrics for the algorithm.  The tracker removes the
    txn field from each event it receives, replacing it with a
    portfolio field to be fed into the user algo. At the end of each
    trading day, the PerformanceTracker also generates a daily
    performance report, which is appended to event's perf_report
    field.

    Fully processed events are run through a batcher generator, which
    batches together events with the same dt field into a single event
    to be fed to the algo. The portfolio object is repeatedly
    overwritten so that only the most recent snapshot of the universe
    is sent to the algo.
